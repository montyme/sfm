      <h3>What is Unauthorized SFMOMA Show</h3>
      <p>Unauthorized SFMOMA Show is a series of solo shows that take place within SFMOMA's  public spaces from April 6th - July 2nd on a rotating basis. Similar to SFMOMA's mission statement, Unauthorized SFMOMA Show is dedicated to making the art for our time a vital and meaningful part of public life. Unauthorized SFMOMA Show is also guided by our commitment to fostering creativity and embracing new ways of seeing the world and the institutions that aim to represent it. To fulfill this goal, we have created a space where to exhibit and share the artwork that everybody wants to see exhibited and shared.</p>

      <p>In order to participate in the exhibition go to "I WANT TO HAVE AN UNAUTHORIZED SFMOMA SHOW", fill in the form, upload your work in digital format (.jpg, .png or .gif) and press "SUBMIT". All works will be accepted at the moment of their submission and will automatically constitute an Unauthorized SFMOMA Solo Show. The period of the exhibition starts when a work is submitted and ends when a new work is submitted. There are NO application or exhibition fees.</p>

      <h3>How to visit the exhibition</h3>
      <p>Unauthorized SFMOMA Shows take place at SFMOMA's public spaces via this website and thus, the only requirement to visit Unauthorized SFMOMA Shows is to be physically present at SFMOMA and have access to a device that can connect to the Internet. Public spaces at SFMOMA don't require a ticket, consequently Unauthorized SFMOMA Shows are also free to visit. Moreover, it is even possible to visit the exhibitions from SFMOMA's entrance, that is, being outside but next to the SFMOMA building (151 3rd St, San Francisco, CA 94103).</p>
